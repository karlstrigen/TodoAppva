Programming assignment for summer internship at Appva.

This is a small to do list implemented in C# and ASP.net with Visual Studio 2017.
The project is set up via New Project -> ASP.NET Core Web Application -> Web Application (Model-View-Controller). This is what is referred to as the "project initialization" in the code comments.

Setup of the database is done in Visual Studio via Tools -> NuGet Package Manager -> Package Manager Console and then running the commands:

```
Add-Migration Initial
Update-Database
```
